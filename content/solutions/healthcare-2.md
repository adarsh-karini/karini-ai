## Challenge:

Traditional business intelligence (BI) tools often need to catch up. They frequently need more self-service capabilities than public health officials, physicians, and life sciences companies need. These stakeholders require a radically different approach to efficiently access and analyze complex health data. This new approach will enable them to prioritize their efforts and respond swiftly to evolving health challenges.

## Solution:

The platform employs an agentic approach, which utilizes AI agents that can work autonomously and proactively across multiple data sources. These AI agents are designed to act independently, make decisions, and perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This agentic approach allows the AI to work within a data warehouse across multiple tables or multiple data warehouses, seamlessly integrating diverse data sources. Doing so empowers users to perform complex analyses without advanced technical skills, facilitating real-time insights and more informed decision-making.

## Benefits:

- Real-time data integration provides immediate access to integrated data from multiple sources, enabling timely trend analysis and predictive modeling while allowing healthcare professionals to focus on their core responsibilities.
- Comprehensive narratives and visualizations that support evidence-based strategies and interventions improve decision-making, ultimately enhancing the quality of decisions made in public health.
- Resource optimization is realized by reducing dependence on data analysts and IT staff for report generation, freeing valuable resources for critical public health initiatives.
- Scalability and collaboration are fostered as the platform seamlessly connects with major data warehouses. This promotes cross-functional collaboration among public health officials, physicians, and researchers while allowing organizations to scale their data analytics as needed.

Karini AI's innovative Text-to-SQL Generative AI solution transforms population health analytics by making complex data accessible and actionable for healthcare professionals. By integrating real-time data from multiple sources and fostering collaboration between technologists and subject matter experts, the platform empowers users to make informed decisions swiftly and effectively.
