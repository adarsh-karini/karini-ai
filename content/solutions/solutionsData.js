			challenges: [
				"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the emphasis on population health. It has highlighted the emergence of new diseases and the urgent need for rapid, data-driven responses. Effectively managing population health requires real-time data integration from multiple sources. This integration is essential for identifying trends and making predictive analyses based on historical events.",

				"Traditional business intelligence (BI) tools often need to catch up. They frequently need more self-service capabilities than public health officials, physicians, and life sciences companies need. These stakeholders require a radically different approach to efficiently access and analyze complex health data. This new approach will enable them to prioritize their efforts and respond swiftly to evolving health challenges.",

			solution: [
				"Karini AI empowers healthcare professionals with an advanced text-to-SQL generative AI solution that revolutionizes how they interact with population health data. The platform features an intuitive BI chatbot that understands natural language queries and supports all major data warehouses, including Amazon Redshift, Teradata, Databricks, Snowflake, and Oracle. Users can ask questions in plain English and receive immediate responses through narratives, tables, and interactive dashboards",

				"The platform employs an agentic approach, which utilizes AI agents that can work autonomously and proactively across multiple data sources. These AI agents are designed to act independently, make decisions, and perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This agentic approach allows the AI to work within a data warehouse across multiple tables or multiple data warehouses, seamlessly integrating diverse data sources. Doing so empowers users to perform complex analyses without advanced technical skills, facilitating real-time insights and more informed decision-making.",
