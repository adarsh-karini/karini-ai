Imagine a world where life-saving diagnoses are delayed simply because there aren't enough radiologists. This isn't science fiction—it's the reality in many parts of the world today.
Radiologists are the unsung heroes of healthcare. They meticulously analyze complex images like CT scans and X-rays. But this process is painfully slow and requires years of expertise. The result? Delayed diagnoses, compromised patient care, and a widening healthcare gap between urban and rural areas.
In short, We're asking too much of too few, and patients are paying the price.
