		title: "Optimizing Compound AI systems",
		overview:
			"Scaling GenAI applications from proof of concept to full-scale production involves managing multiple AI models and pipelines, each tailored for specific tasks. Enterprises must optimize for performance, cost, and latency, which becomes increasingly challenging as they integrate smaller, open-source models with larger systems. Without careful planning, these complexities can lead to delays and increased operational overhead, hampering the potential for widespread adoption.",

	{
		title: "Ensuring Data Quality and Risk Control",
		overview:
			"Poor data quality and insufficient risk controls are leading causes of GenAI project abandonment. As AI models rely heavily on high-quality in context data to generate accurate and reliable outputs, any deficiencies in data quality can result in subpar performance. Furthermore, the absence of robust risk management frameworks can expose enterprises to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, making it challenging to gain stakeholders' buy-in to move forward with production deployments.",

		title: "Managing Costs and Demonstrating Business Value",
		overview:
			"As enterprises progress from GenAI experiments to large-scale deployments, costs can escalate rapidly, mainly when dealing with sophisticated compound AI systems that require significant computational resources. Additionally, demonstrating clear and tangible business value becomes crucial to justify continued investment. With a well-defined cost management and value measurement strategy, projects can be scaled back or abandoned altogether.",
