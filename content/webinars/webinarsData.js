			"Master Practical GenAI Agents with KnowledgeGraph using Karini AI and Neo4J",
		date: "August 19th, 2024",
		description: `While tabular vector stores are effective for many real-world applications, they often need to provide advanced insights for quantitative questions. Knowledge graphs offer significantly higher accuracy for complex use cases such as healthcare record searches, job board resume matching, or legal research. GraphRAG has emerged as a highly discussed topic in Generative AI, yet building real-world applications remains challenging.
		<br/>
		This webinar will explore the benefits of using KnowledgeGraphs with Neo4J and demonstrate how to leverage the Karini AI GenAI foundation to build Knowledge Graph Agents in under 30 minutes. We will also share best practices and insights from developing a real-world legal use case, keeping you engaged and interested in the practical applications of KnowledgeGraphs. Join us to unlock the potential of KnowledgeGraphs in your AI applications.
