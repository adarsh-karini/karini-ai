We’re excited to announce that Karini AI is now a launch partner for the Amazon Q Index, introduced at AWS re:Invent 2024. With this new integration, Karini AI Agents can seamlessly connect to Amazon Q Indexes, opening the door to even more powerful, flexible, and secure enterprise search experiences.

### Building on a Strong Foundation

Karini AI’s Agent 2.0 workflows make it easy to create multi-agent solutions that leverage up-to-date information through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our platform supports fully managed native knowledgebases featuring advanced OCR, PII masking, and sophisticated chunking methods, including recursive, semantic, and layout-aware techniques. Earlier this year, we also introduced GraphRAG recipes that let customers build knowledge graphs powered by Neo4J, enabling advanced and dynamic RAG use cases.

### Partnering with Amazon Q

Amazon Q is a managed RAG service offering over 40 enterprise data connectors. With the newly launched Amazon Q Retrieve Index API, it’s now possible to integrate Amazon Q Indexes into other applications. By joining forces with Amazon Q, Karini AI Agents gain access to a wide range of secure, enterprise-grade data sources without additional overhead.
