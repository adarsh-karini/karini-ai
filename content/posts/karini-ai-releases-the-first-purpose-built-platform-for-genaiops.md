Karini.ai is excited to announce the general availability of the first-of-its-kind purpose-built Generative AI platform designed to power evolution in enterprise AI adoption. The platform, Built by Ex Amazon Web Services (Ex-AWS) AI experts, delivers a new approach to GenAIOps for the complete supervision of DataOps, LLMOps, and DevOps for building, testing, and deploying generative AI applications at speed in the enterprise.

Operationalizing a GenAI app took an average of 30 days, and now it only takes 30 minutes with Karini.ai. That's 1,440 times faster! Users can optimize for performance, scalability, and reliability from a single screen for the first time at speeds never before achievable.

A recent survey by [MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/05/1080618/laying-the-foundation-for-data-and-ai-led-growth/) underscored that over 90% of enterprises have actively invested in Generative AI projects, so the heavy lifting is underway - and the time to value (TTV) clock is running. According to another study by [Everest Group](https://www.everestgrp.com/press-releases/enterprises-aim-to-move-beyond-pilots-accelerate-consumption-of-ai-in-2024everest-group-yates-ltd/), more than 55% of projects are stuck in pilot stages and may never see production due to a lack of necessary security, governance, or safety controls.

Welcome to Karini.ai, the only platform that instantly allows businesses to build, test, and deploy, accelerating TTV exponentially. Karini.ai's platform is a must-have to operationalize and manage GenAI apps at speed, removing the inherent hurdles (governance, quality, and security) and enabling enterprises to adopt Generative AI and realize the promised gains in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Karini.ai's pioneering platform bridges the gap between the vast potential of generative AI and its practical application in t
