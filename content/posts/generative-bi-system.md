Today, traditional data analytics, warehousing, and databases hold vast amounts of data. However, these methods are becoming inadequate as data generation soars with additional sources and multiple Data architectures. Traditional Business Intelligence is time-consuming, requires specialized skills, and produces insights that are hard to interpret and typically hardwired. Decision-makers do not get fresh insights or need to depend on their Data science or Analysts to provide summaries, increasing round trip time and hence delaying decisions.

The State of the art Generative AI models have shown remarkable results in programming tasks such as SQL Generation, Data processing, and Narrative generation hence they have the potential to transform every aspect of the data and analytics lifecycle. Businesses are increasingly planning to integrate generative AI into their BI strategies. There are similar solutions available by cloud providers or BI providers, but they are confined to their own ecosystems and do not reflect the realities of the Enterprise data landscape, which tends to have Data silos across multiple clouds. Many enterprises also need better integration of Generative BI offerings within their own applications.
