Tim Condello, Director of Cloud and AIML at Distributed Technology Group, and Nitin Wagh, Chief Product Officer at Karni AI, unveiled how generative AI will revolutionize the way organizations prepare and respond to Request for Proposals (RFPs) and Request for Information (RFIs).

The webinar showcases Karni AI's robust generative AI foundation (GenAIFoundation) on AWS, addressing common enterprise challenges in AI adoption. Attendees will see a live demonstration of an AI-powered RFP response system featuring unique features like automatic template generation, knowledge base integration, and multi-agent workflow for information extraction and response generation. These features are set to change the game in RFP responding.

The presenters will highlight the unique benefits of the DTG-Karni partnership, which combines technological expertise with a deep understanding of business use cases. This partnership ensures that the AI solutions presented are not only cutting-edge but also practical and applicable to real-world business scenarios.
