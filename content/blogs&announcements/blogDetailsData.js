				<strong>Access to Enterprise Data:</strong> This involves creating
				connectors to various storage solutions and databases, considering
				different ingestion formats like files, tabular data, or API responses.
				Unlike traditional ETL, extraction, cleaning, masking, and chunking
				techniques require special attention, especially when dealing with
				complex structures like tables in PDFs or removing unwanted HTML tags
				from web crawls.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Embedding Algorithms:</strong> The constantly evolving nature of
				embedding algorithms
				<a
					href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(Refer MTEB Leaderboard)</a
				>
				means it's crucial to experiment with the top models to select the most
				effective one for your needs. Failure to do so can adversely impact the
				search process.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Query Phase Management:</strong> This phase can be vulnerable to
				adversarial actors who may try to 'jailbreak'
				<a
					href="https://www.jailbreakchat.com/"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(refer to jailbreakchat)</a
				>
				the prompts or overwhelm the system, impacting other users and
				potentially causing a cost spike.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Chunk Retrieval Process:</strong> For the chunk retrieval
				process, the similarity search may not retrieve adequate information or
				be unable to retrieve matching chunks, leading to insufficient context
				for comprehensive and relevant answers. Advanced retrieval chains are
				required to augment prompts with personalized context. (e.g., What are
				claims exclusions for “my” insurance plan? )
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prompt Efficiency:</strong> Open source LLMs are catching up fast
				with proprietary LLMs in language understanding, as evident in the
				<a
					href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>open LLMs leaderboard</a
				>. Hence, writing efficient prompts is very important to get a relevant
				and comprehensive answer. Bad prompts can either confuse the LLMs or
				lead to inadequate responses.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Understanding the Enterprise Domain:</strong>  While Generative AI effectively addresses numerous inquisitive challenges within enterprises, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to grasp the specific nuances of individual enterprise domains. LLMs are trained on publicly available datasets by crawling the world wide web, but enterprise data is behind firewalls; hence, LLMs may not understand a specific internal term used within a business, leading to an “I don't know” response or a response related to a similar term in Wikipedia dictionary leading to hallucination.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Content Safety:</strong> LLMs may spout toxic or unsafe content without proper guardrails, leading to brand reputation issues. The brand reputation concern is genuine, as reported by Chevrolet’s public AI chatbot<a
				href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/a-chevrolet-dealer-offered-an-ai-chatbot-on-its-website-it-told-customers-to-buy-a-ford/ar-AA1lL6KE?ocid=entnewsntp&cvid=b258df25642b448c8467af9a3bf4c362&ei=18"

				<strong>User Experience:</strong>  Most Gen AI systems do not focus on end-user experience. Chat GPT has set the standard for user experience, but OpenAI has control of the end-to-end pipeline, including the model. Lack of good experiences, such as streaming responses, A/B testing framework, lack of exhaustive user feedback mechanism, adequate seeding questions, or lack of follow-up questions, may diminish user engagement.

			<li>
				<strong>Data Management:</strong> Utilize standard storage, database,
				and SaaS application interfaces to minimize bulk distributed data
				replication and incremental ingestion. To make it LLM-ready, utilize
				distributed runtimes for extraction, cleaning, masking, and chunking
				data. Maintain a copy of source metadata to the vector store to ensure
				downstream querying systems can use it for pre-filtering for more
				relevant answers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Model Selection:</strong>

				Depending on your dataset, use the most appropriate embedding model for
				your use case. Try at least the top 2 embedding model techniques
				<a
					href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(Refer MTEB Leaderboard)</a
				>
				during the experimentation phase to understand search relevance based on
				human-generated standard questions and answer pairs. Utilize synthetic
				questions generated by LLMs if you don't have human-generated
				question-answer pairs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Query Phase Management:</strong> To prevent intentional or
				unintentional adverse behavior, use a suitable classification model to
				block questions and provide canned responses. Monitor adverse prompts
				for trends and take appropriate action to improve classification methods
				iteratively. To safeguard against spam attacks, enable user- and
				token-based throttling to limit attack vectors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Retrieval Optimization:</strong> Use user metadata for
				pre-filtering to produce a narrower set for semantic search for optimal
				retrieval. Many vector databases, such as OpenSearch, MongoDB, and
				Pinecone, provide hybrid search capabilities. Depending on your source
				datasets, use additional retrieval chains to retrieve the entire or
				partial document to provide adequate context for your LLM query. For
				example, in an R&D chatbot, if the user asks to summarize a particular
				science paper, your retrieval chain must retrieve the entire science
				paper based on matching chunks.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Building Efficient System Prompts:</strong> Building system prompts is the most critical task to get the most optimal response. Due to the lack of a universal framework for prompts, ensure you follow the standards most appropriate based on LLM or your task (e.g., conversation, summarization, or classification). Maintain a library of best practice prompts for enterprise-specific use cases to benefit others.  Including and enabling domain experts to design system prompts is essential as they are intimately familiar with datasets and expected outputs. Provide a prompt playground so domain experts can intuitively write system prompts, including examples, “Do not” rules, and expected response format. Provide a playground to quickly compare against authorized models for your enterprise. Maintain versions of the prompts so you can promote the best version to production.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Model Experimentation:</strong> Many enterprises start with SaaS model providers such as Azure OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock. Open-source models such as Llama2, Mistral, and MPT and their variants are catching up fast. Try out your application against at least 2-3 leading SOTA models to understand response time, domain understanding, and quality of response. Typical enterprise applications may not need the bells and whistles of multi-headed SaaS models, so using open-source models may be as effective as you scale out and offer a better price per performance. For the rapid testing, build an evaluation script to utilize the”LLM as a judge” approach to compare the responses' relevance, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. If the general purpose model does not provide relevant and comprehensive responses, resort to domain-specific fine-tuning or instruction fine-tuning techniques and employ the fine-tuned model in your RAG.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Content Safety:</strong> To prevent harmful, toxic responses, augment system prompts to instruct LLMs to redact harmful content from the response. Employ additional controls using other classifiers to block harmful responses entirely to ensure trust and safety. Use a standard set of questions for automated testing to ensure RAGs are regression tested to account for any changes in LLM, system prompts, or changes in data.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enhancing User Experience:</strong> Ultimately, user experience is essential to increase engagement and attract new users. Add streaming if you are building a conversational system, provide appropriate feedback options so users can rate responses, and volunteer to provide correct responses to build the knowledge base. Provide custom instructions, seeding questions to start the conversation, and follow-up questions. Generative AI is rapidly evolving, so it is vital to continue to monitor user feedback and incorporate additional capabilities such as multi-modal (image and text).

							"Generative AI has sparked a wave of excitement among businesses eager to create chatbots, companions, and co-pilots for extracting insights from their data. This journey begins with the art of prompt engineering, which includes various approaches like single-shot, few-shot, and chain of thoughts. Businesses often start by developing internal chatbots to help employees gain insights and boost their productivity. Given that customer support is a significant cost center, it has become a focus for optimization, with the development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for enhanced insights. However, if a customer support RAG system provides inaccurate or misleading information, it could bias the judgment of representatives, leading to misplaced trust in computer-generated responses. Recent incidents involving entities like <a href='https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow' class='text-blue-600' hover:'underline'> Air Canada </a> and a <a href='https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/a-chevrolet-dealer-offered-an-ai-chatbot-on-its-website-it-told-customers-to-buy-a-ford/ar-AA1lL6KE?ocid=entnewsntp&cvid=b258df25642b448c8467af9a3bf4c362&ei=18' target='_blank' rel='nofollow' class='text-blue-600' hover:'underline'> Chevy chatbot</a> have highlighted the reputational and financial risks of deploying unguided chatbots for self-service support.

							`The advent of Generative AI has sparked a wave of enthusiasm among businesses eager to harness its potential for creating Chatbots, companions, and copilots designed to unlock insights from vast datasets. This journey often begins with the art of prompt engineering, which presents itself in various forms, including Single-shot, Few-shot, and Chain of Thought methodologies. Initially, companies tend to deploy internal chatbots to bolster employee productivity by facilitating access to critical insights. Furthermore, customer support, traditionally seen as a cost center, has become a focal point for optimization efforts, leading to the development of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems intended to provide deeper insights. However, challenges such as potential inaccuracies or "hallucinations" in responses generated by these RAG systems can significantly impact customer service representatives' decision-making, potentially resulting in customer dissatisfaction. A notable incident involving <a href='https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know' style='color:rgb(37 99 235 / var(--tw-text-opacity))' target='_blank'>Air Canada</a> has recently highlighted the potential risks to brand reputation and financial stability posed by deploying these autonomous chatbots in customer support scenarios. The prospect of creating similar chatbots for financial advisors, capable of delivering human-like yet fundamentally flawed responses, raises significant concerns. Issues related to quality (such as hallucination, truth grounding, and comprehensiveness), content safety, and the risk of intellectual property leakage are among the key hurdles preventing many generative AI applications from reaching production stages.`,

						<ol style='list-style: inside; list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 25px;'>
						        <li>
								<b>Question semantics:</b> Complex queries often encompass multipart intents that may be unrelated or even adversarial, designed to confuse the model or "jailbreak" the chatbot. These can range from greetings to questions that test the system's limitations or probe for inconsistencies. Without understanding these nuances, a RAG system might fail to appropriately categorize and respond to the query, leading to irrelevant or incorrect answers.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Retrieval phase: </b> A single vector store search may not yield relevant results for complex or multipart statistical questions. Personalized queries, such as those asking for specific information about a user's insurance policy, pose additional challenges if the system needs access to personalized data points like the policies owned by the user. This limitation can prevent the system from providing accurate, user-specific information.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Prompt augmentation:</b> In simpler RAG implementations, the system prompt is static, combined with retrieved contextual information to create an augmented prompt. This static nature can limit the system's ability to dynamically adjust to the specifics of the query, particularly for complex or evolving scenarios that require a more nuanced understanding and response.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>LLM for Summarization:</b> If the augmented prompt lacks the necessary context to answer the query effectively, LLMs may rely on their inherent knowledge base to fill in the gaps, leading to "hallucination," where the model generates plausible but inaccurate or fabricated information. This issue is particularly problematic in scenarios requiring precise, factual responses.

						         <b>Thought</b> in AI agents refers to the internal processing or decision-making mechanisms that occur before taking an action. It involves the interpretation of observations, the weighing of possible actions based on learned experiences or predefined rules, and the formulation of a plan or response.

								 <b>Action</b> is the step an AI agent takes in response to its thoughts and observations. It's the execution phase where the agent applies its decision to the environment, potentially altering its state. Actions can be physical movements, such as a robotic arm picking up an object, or digital responses, like sending a message or updating a database. The scope of actions available to an AI agent depends on its capabilities and the effectors it has to interact with its environment.
