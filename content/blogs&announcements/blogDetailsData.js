				<strong>Access to Enterprise Data:</strong> This involves creating
				connectors to various storage solutions and databases, considering
				different ingestion formats like files, tabular data, or API responses.
				Unlike traditional ETL, extraction, cleaning, masking, and chunking
				techniques require special attention, especially when dealing with
				complex structures like tables in PDFs or removing unwanted HTML tags
				from web crawls.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Embedding Algorithms:</strong> The constantly evolving nature of
				embedding algorithms
				<a

					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(Refer MTEB Leaderboard)</a
				>
				means it's crucial to experiment with the top models to select the most
				effective one for your needs. Failure to do so can adversely impact the
				search process.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Query Phase Management:</strong> This phase can be vulnerable to
				adversarial actors who may try to 'jailbreak'
				<a
					href="https://www.jailbreakchat.com/"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(refer to jailbreakchat)</a
				>
				the prompts or overwhelm the system, impacting other users and
				potentially causing a cost spike.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Chunk Retrieval Process:</strong> For the chunk retrieval
				process, the similarity search may not retrieve adequate information or
				be unable to retrieve matching chunks, leading to insufficient context
				for comprehensive and relevant answers. Advanced retrieval chains are
				required to augment prompts with personalized context. (e.g., What are
				claims exclusions for “my” insurance plan? )
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Prompt Efficiency</strong>Open source LLMs are catching up fast
				with proprietary LLMs in language understanding, as evident in the
				<a
					href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>open LLMs leaderboard</a
				>. Hence, writing efficient prompts is very important to get a relevant
				and comprehensive answer. Bad prompts can either confuse the LLMs or
				lead to inadequate responses.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Understanding the Enterprise Domain:</strong>  While Generative AI effectively addresses numerous inquisitive challenges within enterprises, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to grasp the specific nuances of individual enterprise domains. LLMs are trained on publicly available datasets by crawling the world wide web, but enterprise data is behind firewalls; hence, LLMs may not understand a specific internal term used within a business, leading to an “I don't know” response or a response related to a similar term in Wikipedia dictionary leading to hallucination.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Content Safety:</strong> LLMs may spout toxic or unsafe content without proper guardrails, leading to brand reputation issues. The brand reputation concern is genuine, as reported by Chevrolet’s public AI chatbot<a
				href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/a-chevrolet-dealer-offered-an-ai-chatbot-on-its-website-it-told-customers-to-buy-a-ford/ar-AA1lL6KE?ocid=entnewsntp&cvid=b258df25642b448c8467af9a3bf4c362&ei=18"

				<strong>User Experience:</strong>  Most Gen AI systems do not focus on end-user experience. Chat GPT has set the standard for user experience, but OpenAI has control of the end-to-end pipeline, including the model. Lack of good experiences, such as streaming responses, A/B testing framework, lack of exhaustive user feedback mechanism, adequate seeding questions, or lack of follow-up questions, may diminish user engagement.

				<strong>Data Management:</strong> Utilize standard storage, database,
				and SaaS application interfaces to minimize bulk distributed data
				replication and incremental ingestion. To make it LLM-ready, utilize
				distributed runtimes for extraction, cleaning, masking, and chunking
				data. Maintain a copy of source metadata to the vector store to ensure
				downstream querying systems can use it for pre-filtering for more
				relevant answers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Model Selection:</strong>

				Depending on your dataset, use the most appropriate embedding model for
				your use case. Try at least the top 2 embedding model techniques
				<a
					href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard"
					class="text-blue-600"
					target="_blank" rel=" nofollow"
					>(Refer MTEB Leaderboard)</a
				>
				during the experimentation phase to understand search relevance based on
				human-generated standard questions and answer pairs. Utilize synthetic
				questions generated by LLMs if you don't have human-generated
				question-answer pairs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Query Phase Management:</strong> To prevent intentional or
				unintentional adverse behavior, use a suitable classification model to
				block questions and provide canned responses. Monitor adverse prompts
				for trends and take appropriate action to improve classification methods
				iteratively. To safeguard against spam attacks, enable user- and
				token-based throttling to limit attack vectors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Retrieval Optimization:</strong> Use user metadata for
				pre-filtering to produce a narrower set for semantic search for optimal
				retrieval. Many vector databases, such as OpenSearch, MongoDB, and
				Pinecone, provide hybrid search capabilities. Depending on your source
				datasets, use additional retrieval chains to retrieve the entire or
				partial document to provide adequate context for your LLM query. For
				example, in an R&D chatbot, if the user asks to summarize a particular
				science paper, your retrieval chain must retrieve the entire science
				paper based on matching chunks.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Building Efficient System Prompts</strong>Building system prompts is the most critical task to get the most optimal response. Due to the lack of a universal framework for prompts, ensure you follow the standards most appropriate based on LLM or your task (e.g., conversation, summarization, or classification). Maintain a library of best practice prompts for enterprise-specific use cases to benefit others.  Including and enabling domain experts to design system prompts is essential as they are intimately familiar with datasets and expected outputs. Provide a prompt playground so domain experts can intuitively write system prompts, including examples, “Do not” rules, and expected response format. Provide a playground to quickly compare against authorized models for your enterprise. Maintain versions of the prompts so you can promote the best version to production.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Model Experimentation:</strong> Many enterprises start with SaaS model providers such as Azure OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock. Open-source models such as Llama2, Mistral, and MPT and their variants are catching up fast. Try out your application against at least 2-3 leading SOTA models to understand response time, domain understanding, and quality of response. Typical enterprise applications may not need the bells and whistles of multi-headed SaaS models, so using open-source models may be as effective as you scale out and offer a better price per performance. For the rapid testing, build an evaluation script to utilize the”LLM as a judge” approach to compare the responses' relevance, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. If the general purpose model does not provide relevant and comprehensive responses, resort to domain-specific fine-tuning or instruction fine-tuning techniques and employ the fine-tuned model in your RAG.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Content Safety:</strong> To prevent harmful, toxic responses, augment system prompts to instruct LLMs to redact harmful content from the response. Employ additional controls using other classifiers to block harmful responses entirely to ensure trust and safety. Use a standard set of questions for automated testing to ensure RAGs are regression tested to account for any changes in LLM, system prompts, or changes in data.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enhancing User Experience:</strong> Ultimately, user experience is essential to increase engagement and attract new users. Add streaming if you are building a conversational system, provide appropriate feedback options so users can rate responses, and volunteer to provide correct responses to build the knowledge base. Provide custom instructions, seeding questions to start the conversation, and follow-up questions. Generative AI is rapidly evolving, so it is vital to continue to monitor user feedback and incorporate additional capabilities such as multi-modal (image and text).
