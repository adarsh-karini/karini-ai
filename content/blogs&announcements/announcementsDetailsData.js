Creating the streaming experience with large models like GPT4 is more straightforward but, at the same time, challenging in enterprise environments where you may need a wide array of state-of-the-art (SOTA) model providers ranging from open source to SaaS. Each LLM is nuanced in its capabilities to stream tokens and the	quality of response. So, it’s tough to build a uniform user	experience across the ecosystem of model providers, diminishing	and degrading users’ engagement.",

Generative AI drives more domain experts and business users to take up prompt engineering as they understand enterprise data better than their technical counterparts.
